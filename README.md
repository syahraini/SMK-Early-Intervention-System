**A data-informed decision-support system for preventing silent dropout and skill-poor graduation.**

#Project Overview#
This project designs a data-driven early-intervention system for under-resourced vocational schools serving low-income and rural communities.

Many such schools face a silent failure mode:
students gradually disengage, attendance collapses, grades deteriorate — and yet promotion decisions are still made based on incomplete, fragmented, or purely compassionate judgment.

As a result, students often:

graduate without being skill-ready
are promoted despite chronic disengagement
or drop out after problems are detected too late to reverse
This system was designed to help schools move from late, intuition-based decisions to early, humane, and evidence-informed interventions — without turning education into a surveillance or punishment mechanism.

Problem Context
In marginalized vocational schools, three systemic failures often coexist:

Data Fragmentation

Attendance is recorded manually on paper
Grades are stored in isolated spreadsheets
No unified student performance view exists
Late Detection of Risk

Chronic absenteeism and grade collapse are often discovered only during promotion meetings
At that point, meaningful intervention is already too late
Compassion-Driven but Unstructured Decisions

Students are promoted out of pity rather than readiness
Admission decisions are made without prior student risk assessment
Intervention happens only after disengagement becomes severe
This system reframes data not as a tool for control,
but as an instrument for care, early support, and dignity preservation.

System Goals
The system is designed to:

Detect student disengagement early
Support homeroom teachers in timely intervention
Enable structured, transparent promotion decisions
Improve parent–school communication
Protect vulnerable students from silent dropout
Preserve humane, human-centered education values
System Scope
The current version focuses on:

Student attendance tracking
Academic performance monitoring
Early risk scoring
Alert generation (Soft Alert & Critical Alert)
Intervention logging
Parent communication support
It does not automate promotion or disciplinary decisions.
All outputs are strictly advisory.

Primary Users
Homeroom Teachers
Full visibility into student risk profiles and intervention history

Subject Teachers
Visibility into performance data for their own subjects only

School Leadership (Future V2)
Aggregate risk distribution and intervention effectiveness

Parents
Attendance alerts and communication channel with teachers

Core Features
Unified student profile (attendance + grades + alerts)
Risk scoring engine
Alert logic (3-day Soft Alert, 6-day Critical Alert)
Intervention workflow
Parent messaging interface
Role-based data access
Design Philosophy
This system is guided by five core principles:

Care Over Control
Data exists to support students, not monitor or punish them.

Human Judgment Over Automation
All alerts and risk scores are advisory only.

Early Intervention Over Late Punishment
The system prioritizes reversible, low-stakes interventions.

Transparency Over Black-Box Logic
Every alert shows the rule logic that triggered it.

Dignity Preservation
No stigmatizing labels or shaming language is used.

Governance & Ethics
The system includes built-in safeguards:

Role-based data visibility
Advisory-only decision outputs
Transparent alert logic
Parent communication logs
No automated promotion or expulsion triggers
Data used strictly for care and safeguarding
Technical Components
Data schema (students, attendance, grades, alerts, interventions)
Risk scoring logic
Alert rule engine
Intervention workflow engine
Analytics layer (future V2)
