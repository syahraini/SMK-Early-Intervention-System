# Policy Simulation Mode

## Purpose
Allow administrators to test rule changes before applying them.

## Example Simulations
- What if soft alert = 2 days instead of 3?
- What if grade weight = 40% instead of 30%?

## Output Metrics
- Number of alerts triggered
- Teacher workload increase
- Intervention count

## Ethical Safeguards
- Simulation never affects real students
- Used only for governance decisions
