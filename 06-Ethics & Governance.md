# ETHICS & GOVERNANCE

## Purpose

This document defines the ethical principles, governance safeguards, and accountability structures of the Student Early-Intervention Decision Support System.

The system is explicitly designed to:

* Protect student dignity and rights
* Enable early care and support
* Prevent silent disengagement
* Avoid surveillance, punishment, or automation of harm

It treats data as a tool for care — not control.

---

## Core Ethical Stance

> **This system exists to protect vulnerable students, not to monitor or discipline them.**

All design decisions prioritize:

* Student welfare
* Human judgment
* Compassionate intervention
* Proportionality
* Transparency

---

## Ethical Design Principles

### 1. Purpose Limitation

Data is collected and used **only** for:

* Detecting early signs of disengagement
* Supporting humane academic intervention
* Facilitating communication with parents

The system must never be used for:

* Public ranking of students
* Automated punishment
* Institutional reputation management
* Staff performance surveillance

---

### 2. Data Minimization

Only data strictly necessary for early intervention is collected:

* Attendance events
* Academic assessment results
* Basic enrollment context
* Intervention outcomes

The system explicitly avoids:

* Psychological profiling
* Behavioral surveillance
* Social media or third‑party data
* Permanent negative labeling

---

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Safeguard

All decisions affecting students require human judgment.

The system:

* Generates advisory alerts only
* Never mandates action
* Never enforces promotion or retention
* Never labels a student as a dropout

---

### 4. Non-Punitive Framing

All alerts and dashboards are framed as:

* Support signals
* Care prompts
* Early warnings

Not as:

* Discipline triggers
* Compliance violations
* Performance rankings

---

### 5. Right to Explanation

Every risk score and alert must:

* Be explainable in plain language
* Cite concrete events (absences, low scores)
* Avoid opaque or statistical reasoning

---

### 6. Proportionality

Interventions must be:

* Proportionate to risk
* Context-aware
* Reversible

Light-touch communication is preferred over escalation.

---

## Student Rights

Each student has the right to:

* Be treated as a person, not a data point
* Not be permanently labeled as high-risk
* Have context considered before decisions
* Receive supportive intervention before punitive consequences

---

## Parent Rights

Parents or guardians have the right to:

* Be informed when alerts are generated
* Receive understandable explanations
* Reply within the system
* Participate in intervention decisions

---

## Teacher Rights and Responsibilities

Teachers have the right to:

* Override system recommendations
* Add qualitative context
* Use professional judgment

Teachers are responsible for:

* Using data ethically
* Avoiding stigmatization
* Documenting interventions truthfully

---

## Governance Structure

### Roles

* Homeroom Teacher: primary decision-maker
* Subject Teacher: performance input only
* Operator: data entry and integrity
* Principal: ethical oversight only

---

## Auditability

The system logs:

* Risk recalculations
* Alert generation
* Interventions
* Parent communications

Audit logs exist to:

* Detect misuse
* Enable accountability
* Support ethical review

---

## Misuse Prevention

Explicitly prohibited uses:

* Using risk scores for expulsion decisions
* Publicly sharing risk rankings
* Using data for staff punishment
* Using the system to justify neglect

---

## Bias and Fairness Considerations

Recognized risks:

* Socioeconomic bias
* Access-to-school bias
* Teacher reporting bias

Mitigations:

* Equal weighting of attendance and grades
* Human review before escalation
* Decay logic to prevent permanent stigma

---

## Transparency and Consent

Students and parents must be informed that:

* The system exists
* What data is collected
* Why it is used
  n- That it does not replace human judgment

---

## Limitations

This system:

* Does not diagnose psychological issues
* Does not predict long-term outcomes
* Does not replace teachers or counselors

---

## Ethical Boundary Statement

> This system must be shut down or redesigned if it is ever used to harm, shame, punish, or exclude students.
